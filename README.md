Hi my name is Trent Bowers and I am a new student in software devolopment at tech elevator. I enjoy pc gaming, movies, music, and animals. I've done construction and worked on a farm for most of my life so this is my first time getting into this sort of thing. I look forward to learning and working with like minded people.
